# Design Patterns Showcase

This repository contains simple Proof of Concept (PoC) projects showcasing various design patterns of software development.

## Patterns Included

1. **Adapter**: Demonstrates how the Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
2. **Strategy**: Illustrates the Strategy pattern, enabling algorithms to be selected at runtime.
3. **State**: Displays the State pattern, which alters an object's behavior when its internal state changes.
4. **Factory**: Showcases the Factory pattern, responsible for creating objects without specifying the exact class.
5. **Builder**: Exemplifies the Builder pattern, used to construct complex objects step by step.
6. **Observer**: Exposes the Observer pattern, where objects can subscribe to and receive updates from a subject.
7. **Singleton**: Highlights the Singleton pattern, ensuring a class has only one instance.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to each project's directory to examine its implementation.
3. Run and experiment with the code to understand how the design patterns function in practice.

Happy coding!
